## Project Status & Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

Currently, the project has **completed Phase 1 (Core Functionality and Polishing)**, including business/user management, authentication, tiers, rewards, points, QR codes (with functional mobile scanning), admin/customer dashboards, and comprehensive admin customer management (CRUD, filters, bulk actions).
A **general code cleanup and refactoring** has also been performed.
Frontend **Internationalization (i18n) has been completed**, supporting Spanish and English with a language switcher.
**Backend Automated Testing has been initiated** (setup and initial unit/integration tests).

**Next Steps:**

1.  **(Technical):** Continue expanding **Automated Test** coverage (Backend and Frontend).
2.  **(Functional - Phase 2):** Begin implementing the next expansion features (e.g., Advanced Loyalty, Basic Communication).

For a more detailed roadmap, please refer to [`PROJECT_STATE_AND_ROADMAP.md`](PROJECT_STATE_AND_ROADMAP.md).

## API Documentation üìñ

The backend API is documented using the OpenAPI 3.0 standard. While the backend server is running (see "Running the Project" below), you can access the interactive **Swagger UI** documentation at:

**`/api-docs`**

For example, if the backend is running locally on port 3000, the documentation URL would be `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`.

This interface allows you to:

- Explore all available API endpoints.
- View details about request parameters, request bodies, and response schemas.
- Test the API endpoints directly from your browser (authentication might be required for protected routes).

## Installation and Local Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To get the project up and running in your development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or v20 recommended)
- yarn (v1.x recommended)
- Accessible PostgreSQL database server running locally.
- (Optional) NVM or similar.

### Backend Setup

1.  Clone repo & `cd LoyalPyME/backend`
2.  `yarn install`
3.  Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`
4.  **Configure `.env`:** Fill in `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`.
5.  Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
6.  Generate Prisma client: **`npx prisma generate`** (Important!)
7.  **Initial Data:** Choose **Option A (Seed):** `npx prisma db seed` (if implemented) OR **Option B (Manual):** Register via `/register-business` frontend route.

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to `frontend` folder (`cd ../frontend`)
2.  Install dependencies: `yarn install`

## Running the Project ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1.  Ensure your PostgreSQL server is **running**.
2.  **Start the Backend** (from `backend/` folder):

    - **Recommended Method (Development with Hot-Reload - Requires 2 Terminals):**
      ```bash
      # Terminal 1: Continuous compilation
      npx tsc --watch
      # Terminal 2: Execution and auto-restart
      npx nodemon dist/index.js
      ```
    - **Alternative Method (Stable, No Hot-Reload):**
      ```bash
      yarn build && node dist/index.js
      # (Repeat after each change)
      ```
    - **`yarn dev` Method (NOT RECOMMENDED):** Unstable in the current environment.
    - _(Backend runs on port 3000 or as configured)_

3.  **Start the Frontend** (from `frontend/` folder):
    ```bash
    # Use --host for network access and HTTPS
    yarn dev --host
    ```
    _(Frontend runs on port 5173)_

Access via `https://localhost:5173` (PC) or the network URL (Mobile). Remember the **API documentation** is available at `/api-docs` on the backend server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`).

#### **Accessing from Mobile (Local Network)**

1.  Find PC's Local IP (`ipconfig` / `ifconfig`).
2.  Ensure Servers Running (Backend and Frontend).
3.  Check PC Firewall (Allow incoming TCP on 5173 and 3000 for Private network).
4.  Check Vite Config (`server: { host: true, https: true, proxy: { ... } }`).
5.  Access on Mobile: `https://<YOUR_PC_IP>:5173`. Accept security warning.
