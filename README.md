## Project Status & Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

Currently, the project has **completed Phase 1 (Core Functionality)**, including business/user management, authentication, tiers, rewards, points, QR codes (with functional mobile scanning), admin/customer dashboards, and comprehensive admin customer management (list, details, individual/bulk actions, filters).

Additionally, a **general code cleanup and refactoring** has been performed on both the frontend and backend to improve maintainability.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1.  **(Technical - High Priority):** Implement **Automated Tests**.
2.  **(Functional - Phase 2):** Begin implementing **Internationalization (i18n)**.

For a more detailed roadmap, please refer to [`PROJECT_STATE_AND_ROADMAP.md`](PROJECT_STATE_AND_ROADMAP.md).

## Used Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

**Frontend:**

- React & TypeScript
- Vite (Build Tool)
- Mantine UI (v7+) & Mantine Hooks
- `@mantine/form` & `zod` (Form Validation)
- `@mantine/notifications` (UI Feedback)
- `@mantine/modals` (Modals)
- Axios (API Requests)
- React Router DOM (v6+)
- `qrcode.react`, `html5-qrcode` (QR Functionality)
- `vite-plugin-mkcert` (For HTTPS Dev)

**Backend:**

- Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- Prisma (ORM)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- JWT (Authentication) & bcryptjs (Hashing)
- dotenv (Environment Variables)
- node-cron (Scheduled Tasks - Tier Logic)
- uuid (Unique IDs)
- cors, `date-fns`
- `ts-node`, `ts-node-dev` (Development Dependencies - _Limited use due to instability_)

## Installation and Local Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To get the project up and running in your development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or v20 recommended)
- yarn (v1.x recommended)
- Accessible PostgreSQL database server running locally.
- (Optional but recommended for managing Node versions) NVM or similar.

### Backend Setup

1.  Clone repo & `cd LoyalPyME/backend`
2.  `yarn install`
3.  Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` (`cp .env.example .env`)
4.  **Configure `.env`:** Fill in your local `DATABASE_URL` details and generate a strong, random `JWT_SECRET`. **Do not commit `.env`**.
5.  Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
6.  Generate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
7.  **Initial Data (IMPORTANT):**
    - **Option A: Seed (Recommended if implemented):** Run `npx prisma db seed`. Check `prisma/seed.ts` for example credentials.
    - **Option B: Manual Registration:** If no seed exists, after starting the app, navigate to the `/register-business` route in the frontend and create your first business and admin user.
      _(Confirm which option applies to the current version)._
8.  (Optional) `npx ts-node scripts/hash-customer-password.ts` for specific test users (if needed).

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to `frontend` folder (`cd ../frontend`)
2.  Install dependencies: `yarn install`

## Running the Project ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1.  Ensure your PostgreSQL server is **running**.
2.  **Start the Backend** (from `backend/` folder):

    - **Stable Method (Recommended for Development & Production):**
      ```bash
      # Compile TS to JS
      yarn build
      # Run the compiled JS
      node dist/index.js
      ```
      _(You will need to repeat `yarn build && node dist/index.js` after each backend code change)._
    - **Hot-Reload Method (Development Only - Requires 2 Terminals):**

      ```bash
      # In Terminal 1 (compile and watch src/):
      npx tsc --watch

      # In Terminal 2 (run and watch dist/):
      npx nodemon dist/index.js
      ```

      _(This is the recommended method for active development as it automatically restarts the server when `.ts` files are saved)._

    - **`yarn dev` Method (CURRENTLY NOT RECOMMENDED):**
      Due to instabilities with `ts-node-dev`, the original `yarn dev` command does not work reliably in the current setup. Please use the two-terminal method.
      _(Backend runs on port 3000 or as configured in `.env`)_

3.  **Start the Frontend** (from `frontend/` folder):
    ```bash
    # Use --host for network access and HTTPS (requires mkcert setup)
    yarn dev --host
    ```
    _(Frontend runs on port 5173. Check the `Network:` URL in the console for access from other devices on the local network)._

Access via `https://localhost:5173` (on PC, accept security warning) or the `Network:` URL (on Mobile, accept security warning).

#### **Accessing from Mobile (Local Network)**

To test the frontend on a mobile device on the same network:

1.  **Find PC's Local IP:** Use `ipconfig` (Win) or `ip addr show` / `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux). (e.g., `192.168.X.Y`).
2.  **Ensure Servers Running:** Backend (using the **two-terminal** method or `node dist/index.js`) and Frontend (`yarn dev --host`).
3.  **Check PC Firewall:** Allow incoming **TCP** connections on ports **5173** (Vite) and **3000** (Backend) for your **Private** network profile.
4.  **Check Vite Config:** Ensure `frontend/vite.config.ts` includes `server: { host: true, https: true, proxy: { ... } }`.
5.  **Access on Mobile:** Open browser on mobile and navigate to `https://<YOUR_PC_IP>:5173`. **Accept the security warning**.
