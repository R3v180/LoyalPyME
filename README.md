## Project Status & Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

LoyalPyME's development follows a phased approach, ensuring a solid foundation before expanding functionality.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Operational Core & Refactoring (Completed)

The foundational phase, focused on building the core loyalty engine and undertaking significant refactoring for maintainability and scalability, is complete.

**Key Achievements:**

- **Full-Stack Platform:** Operational Frontend (React/TS/Mantine) and Backend (Node/Express/TS/Prisma/PostgreSQL).
- **Major Refactoring:** Successfully refactored both frontend (hooks, components) and backend (services, controllers per module) for improved structure and separation of concerns.
- **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based system with registration (Admin/Customer), login, password recovery, and role-based access control (`BUSINESS_ADMIN`, `CUSTOMER_FINAL`).
- **Tier System (Backend Complete):** Admin CRUD for Tiers, business-level configuration, automated tier calculation based on metrics (spend, visits, points), and a CRON job for periodic updates/downgrades.
- **Reward Management:** Full Admin CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Toggle Active) for rewards.
- **Core Points Flow:**
  - Admin QR Code Generation (FE+BE).
  - Customer QR Code Validation (FE+BE) triggering point assignment, metric updates, and tier logic updates.
- **User Panels:**
  - **Customer Dashboard:** View points, current tier level & name; view available rewards & assigned gifts; redeem rewards (points) and gifts.
  - **Admin Panel:** Basic layout (Header, Sidebar), simple Overview page.
- **Admin Customer Management:**
  - Paginated and sortable customer list.
  - Basic search (name/email).
  - **Individual Actions:** View Details (incl. notes), Edit Admin Notes, Adjust Points, Change Tier (manual), Mark/Unmark Favorite, Activate/Deactivate, Assign Reward as Gift.
  - **Bulk Actions:** Multi-select, Bulk Activate/Deactivate, Bulk Delete (with confirmation), Bulk Adjust Points (via modal).

## Installation and Local Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To get the project up and running in your development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended, check project specifics)
- yarn (v1.x recommended, check project specifics)
- Accessible PostgreSQL database server running locally.

### Backend Setup

1.  Clone the repository and navigate to the `backend` folder:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/R3v180/LoyalPyME.git](https://github.com/R3v180/LoyalPyME.git)
    cd LoyalPyME/backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Create your local environment file:** Locate the `backend/.env.example` file provided in the repository. Copy it to a new file named `backend/.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    _(See `backend/.env.example` for variable details and examples)._
4.  **Configure your `.env` file:** Open the newly created `backend/.env` file and:
    - Replace the `DATABASE_URL` placeholders (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`) with your **actual local PostgreSQL connection details**. _(Example: `postgresql://postgres:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/loyalpymedb?schema=public` - Adjust user/password/db name with your local details!)_
    - Replace the `JWT_SECRET` placeholder with a **strong, unique, random string** (at least 32 characters long). You can generate one using `openssl rand -hex 32` in your terminal or a reliable online generator. **Do not use the placeholder value!**
    - Optionally, set the `PORT` if you need the backend to run on a port other than 3000.
    - **Important:** Ensure your `.env` file is listed in your root `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing secrets.
5.  **Set up the database schema:** Run Prisma migrations:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```
    _(This will create the database if it doesn't exist and apply all schema changes.)_
6.  **Generate Prisma Client:** (Usually done by `migrate dev`, but safe to run explicitly)
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```
7.  **Initial Data & Test Credentials (IMPORTANT - Action Required):**
    To log in and test the application, you need initial data like a business and an admin user. The preferred method needs to be finalized for this project. **Choose ONE option below and follow its steps:**

    - **[ ] Option A: Database Seeding (Recommended - Needs Setup/Confirmation)**

      - Run the seed command: `npx prisma db seed`
      - This command _should_ populate the database with essential initial data (e.g., a default business, an admin user, potentially default tiers).
      - **Test Credentials (Example - Confirm/Change in `prisma/seed.ts`!):** `admin@loyalpyme.test` / `password123`
      - _(Note: This requires a functional `prisma/seed.ts` script. If it doesn't exist or work, use Option B)._

    - **[ ] Option B: Manual Registration (If no seed script)**
      - After starting both backend and frontend (see "Running the Project"), open your browser to `http://localhost:5173/register-business`.
      - Use the form to register your first business and administrator account. Use these credentials to log in.

    _(Project Maintainer: Please confirm the intended setup flow (A or B), implement the seed script if choosing A, update the example credentials, and remove the non-applicable option from these instructions.)_

8.  **(Optional) Specific Test Customer Setup:**
    - For specific scenarios requiring a pre-defined customer, you might need to create one manually in your database (using pgAdmin or similar) and then use the provided script to hash their password:
      ```bash
      # Edit 'scripts/hash-customer-password.ts' with the correct email/password first!
      npx ts-node scripts/hash-customer-password.ts
      ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` folder (from the project root):
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
    _(If you were in `backend`, use `cd ../frontend`)_
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Project ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1.  Ensure your PostgreSQL server is **running**.
2.  **Start the backend** (from the `backend` folder):

    ```bash
    # Recommended (stable, reflects production build):
    yarn build && node dist/index.js

    # Alternative for development (currently may have issues):
    # yarn dev
    ```

    _Note: `yarn dev` might not work reliably due to issues with `ts-node-dev`. Using `build && start` is the current stable method._
    Backend runs on `http://localhost:3000` (or the `PORT` specified in `.env`).

3.  **Start the frontend** (from the `frontend` folder, in a separate terminal):
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

Access the application via `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. Log in using the credentials created or provided during the "Initial Data & Test Credentials" step.
