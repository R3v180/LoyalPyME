# LoyalPyME üá¨üáß (v1.15.0)

**LoyalPyME** is a comprehensive and modular full-stack web platform (React Frontend + Node.js Backend) designed for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). The platform consists of different modules that can be activated per business:

- **LoyalPyME Core:** A robust system for managing digital customer loyalty programs (points, tiers, custom rewards, QR codes for earning, customer dashboard, etc.).
- **LoyalPyME Waiter (In Development):** An advanced module focused on digitizing and optimizing service operations in the hospitality sector. It will include features like a digital menu accessible via table QR codes, customer/waiter ordering, Kitchen/Bar Display System (KDS), table management, and a waiter interface.

The platform is engineered to be maintainable, scalable, and adaptable to the specific needs of each business.

## Vision and Purpose ‚ú®

LoyalPyME aims to be the technological ally for SMEs, providing integrated digital tools to enhance their growth and efficiency.
With **LoyalPyME Core**, businesses can foster customer loyalty and recurrence, building stronger, lasting relationships.
With the upcoming **LoyalPyME Waiter** module, hospitality businesses will be able to modernize their operations, reduce errors, streamline service, significantly improve the end-customer experience, and gain valuable operational insights.
The platform is versatile, with applications in retail, various services (for LoyalPyME Core), and a strong focus on hospitality (for LoyalPyME Waiter).

      2.  `yarn dev:run` (or `npx nodemon dist/index.js`)
3.  **Frontend:**
    - `cd ../frontend && yarn install`
